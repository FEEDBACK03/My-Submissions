						<h3 class="text-centre">Red Dead Redemption 2</h3>
						<p>
							After a botched ferry heist in 1899, the Van der Linde gang is forced to leave its substantial money stash and flee Blackwater. The gang realizes that the progress of civilization is ending the time of outlaws, and so decide to gain enough money to escape the law and retire. The gang members rob a train owned by Leviticus Cornwall, who responds by hiring the Pinkertons to apprehend them. Dutch continually promises that the next heist will be their last.

                            Cornwall retaliates for the train heist, culminating in a deadly shootout in Valentine. The gang relocates to Lemoyne, where they meet the Grays and Braithwaites. Dutch tries to pit the families against each other but underestimates them. The gang is ambushed by the Grays and Sean is killed; meanwhile, the Braithwaites kidnap Jack. The gang retaliates and destroys both families, before retrieving Jack from Bronte, who embraces the gang. He offers them leads on work, but double-crosses them. Dutch kidnaps and feeds him to an alligator as revenge, which disturbs Arthur.

                            The gang commits a bank robbery in Saint Denis. The Pinkertons intervene, arresting John and killing Hosea and Lenny. Dutch, Arthur, Bill, Javier, and Micah escape the city via a ship heading to Cuba. A torrential storm sinks the ship, and the men wash ashore on the island of Guarma, where they become embroiled in a war between the tyrannical sugar plantation owners and enslaved local population. The group successfully aids the revolution against the plantation owners and secures transport back to the United States.

                            The group reunites with the rest of the gang, and Dutch obsesses over one last heist. Dutch doubts Arthur's loyalty after he disobeys him by liberating John earlier than planned. He takes Micah on as his new lieutenant, replacing Arthur. Arthur becomes concerned that Dutch is no longer the man he knew, as he is becoming insular, abandons their ideals, and murders Cornwall. He is faced with his mortality when he is diagnosed with tuberculosis. Arthur reflects on his actions and how to protect the gang following his death, telling John to run away with Abigail and Jack and openly defying Dutch by aiding the local Native American people.

                            When the Pinkertons assault the camp, Dutch becomes paranoid that a gang member is working as an informant. Several gang members become disenchanted and leave, while Dutch and Micah arrange one final heist of an Army payroll train. Arthur's faith in Dutch is shattered when he abandons Arthur to the Army, leaves John for dead, and refuses to rescue Abigail when she is taken. Arthur and Sadie rescue Abigail from Milton, who names Micah as the Pinkertons' informer before Abigail kills him.

                            Arthur returns to the camp and openly accuses Micah of betrayal. Dutch, Bill, Javier, and Micah turn on Arthur and the newly returned John, but the standoff is broken when the Pinkertons return. The player can choose to have Arthur aid John's escape by delaying the Pinkertons or return to the camp to recover the gang's money. Micah ambushes Arthur, and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to abandon Micah and leave. If the player has high honor, Arthur succumbs to his injuries and disease and dies while watching the sunrise; if the player has low honor, Micah executes him.

                            Eight years later, in 1907, John and his family are trying to lead honest lives. They find work at a ranch where John fights back against outlaws threatening his employer. Abigail believes John is unwilling to give up his old ways and leaves with Jack. John takes out a bank loan and purchases a ranch. He works with Uncle, Sadie, and Charles to build a new home and proposes to Abigail on her return. John, Sadie, and Charles pursue Micah. Dutch has also recently arrived at Micah's camp, but shoots him and leaves in silence, allowing John to finish him off. John finds the Blackwater stash and pays his debt. John marries Abigail and they start their new life on their ranch alongside Jack and Uncle, as Sadie and Charles leave for other pursuits.

                            The final scene shows Edgar Ross observing John's ranch, foreshadowing the events of Red Dead Redemption.

						<h3 class="text-centre">Rise of the Tomb Raider</h3>
						<p>
							One year after the events of Tomb Raider, archaeologist Lara Croft is struggling to explain her experience of the supernatural on Yamatai and is experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder. Looking for answers, she turns to her late father's research on the lost city of Kitezh and the promise of immortality. Her father's partner, Ana, warns Lara that her father, Lord Croft's obsession with Kitezh, drove him to ruin and suicide. Lara ignores her and organizes an expedition to the Forgotten Cities in northwestern Syria, hoping to uncover the tomb of the Prophet of Constantinople, who is a key figure in the Kitezh legend. The tomb is empty, and Lara is interrupted by Trinity—an ancient order of knights turned paramilitary organization investigating the supernatural—and their leader, Konstantin. As she flees, Lara discovers a symbol etched into the tomb, which she links to a book on Russian religious history in her father's study at Croft Manor. She learns of an artifact called the Divine Source, said to be capable of granting immortality. After arguing with her friend Jonah Maiava regarding the artifact's existence, a Trinity assassin infiltrates the manor and steals the book, prompting the two to go to Siberia.

                            In Siberia, Lara and Jonah are separated by an avalanche while climbing a mountain. Via radio contact, Lara urges Jonah to leave and not look for her. After gathering resources to craft shelter and a bow, Lara discovers that Trinity has made a Soviet-era installation a base of operations in their search for Kitezh. Lara is caught trying to retrieve the book and is imprisoned with Ana. Konstantin forces her to reveal what she knows by slowly strangling Ana in front of her, but Lara cannot provide useful information. Upon realizing Lara does not know the whereabouts of the source, Ana reveals that she works for Trinity and that Konstantin is her brother. She asks Lara to join Trinity, but she refuses and is taken to the Gulag cells, where she meets a man named Jacob. Together they escape the Gulag, and Trinity pursues them. During the chase, Lara is incapacitated and nearly drowns, but Jacob saves her, and she later agrees to aid him, and his people repel Trinity.

                            Upon reaching the valley of the Remnant, Lara discovers that Jacob is their leader and that they are descendants of the Prophet's followers. Trinity repeatedly attacks the Remnant, justifying the slaughter as God's will. However, Lara discovers that Ana suffers a terminal illness and seeks the Divine Source to cure herself. Jacob warns Lara that the Divine Source is real but not what she expects it to be. Lara's goal remains the same despite Jacob's warning, and she sets out to find the Atlas: an artifact that shows the way to Kitezh. Sofia, Jacob's daughter, warns Lara of the Deathless Ones, who guard the Atlas and kill trespassers. Lara finds the Atlas located in the archives beneath the ruins of a Cathedral building. She recovers the artifact and is attacked by The Deathless Ones. She narrowly escapes and is later reunited with Jonah who was found by the Remnant and brought to the valley. He admits he spied on Trinity, but Konstantin was aware of his presence and followed him in the hope of finding Lara. After Lara discovers the path to Kitezh, Trinity forces return to the valley and attack. They take the Atlas and capture Jonah, shooting Jacob in the process. Lara returns to the Gulag to find Jonah. She eventually does, but Konstantin mortally wounds him. Lara, along with some captured remnants from the Gulag bring Jonah to Jacob, who heals him. Upon witnessing Jonah's rapid recovery, Lara realizes that Jacob is the Prophet, given immortality by the Divine Source.

                            With Trinity advancing on the glacier, which looms over Kitezh, Lara is forced to enter the city on a dangerous path and encounters the Deathless Ones, the city's immortal guardians that keep the power of the source. Reading journals written by a Trinity agent, Lara realizes the truth of Jacob's warning: the Divine Source bestows immortality at the cost of one's self. Trinity breaks through the ice and enters the Chamber of Souls, the place that houses the Divine Source. With aid from Sofia and the Remnant, Lara battles her way through Trinity towards the Chamber of Souls, destroying Konstantin's helicopter. Konstantin survives the crash and ambushes Lara, but she mortally wounds him. Before he dies, Konstantin reveals that Lara's father did not commit suicide but was assassinated by Trinity. Lara enters the Chamber of Souls but is too late to prevent Ana from retrieving the Divine Source. Lara tries to reason with Ana to no avail. As Jacob arrives and The Deathless Ones close in, Ana activates the Divine Source but is overwhelmed by its power, giving Lara a chance to pick up the Divine Source and smash it to pieces, causing The Deathless Ones to perish. Jacob's immortality is lost but is happy his time has finally come. He assures Lara she has made a difference and peacefully disintegrates.

                            Two weeks later, at Croft Manor, Lara and Jonah overlook their next expedition. Lara vows to investigate more of the world's mysteries and thwart Trinity's plans. In a post-credits scene, two weeks before Lara and Jonah leave Siberia, Lara asks Ana if she killed her father. Ana denies it, admitting that Trinity gave her the order. Before she can reveal anything else, she is killed by a sniper, who asks his unseen superior about killing Lara and is ordered to stand down for the time being.

						<h3 class="text-centre">Far Cry 4</h3>
						<p>
							After the death of his mother Ishwari, Ajay Ghale (James A. Woods) returns to his home country of Kyrat to carry out Ishwari's final wish by returning her ashes to Lakshmana. However, his mission is interrupted when the bus he is traveling on is attacked by the Royal Army and he is taken prisoner by Pagan Min (Troy Baker), the country's eccentric and violent king. After finding his way through Pagan's mansion, Ajay escapes with the aid of Sabal (Naveen Andrews), a commander in the Golden Path, a rebel movement established by Ajay's father, Mohan Ghale. Ajay is not able to leave the country as the Royal Army has taken control of Kyrat's only airport and sealed the borders.

                            In the twenty-odd years since Ishwari and Ajay fled Kyrat, the rebellion has stagnated, with the Golden Path now fighting for their very existence. As the son of Mohan Ghale, Ajay becomes a symbol for the Golden Path to rally around. After freeing a group of hostages and liberating territory held by Pagan, the Golden Path plan on breaking Pagan's stranglehold on power by targeting his three regional governors: Paul "De Pleur" Harmon (Travis Willingham), who oversees opium production and runs Pagan's torture chambers; Noore Najjar (Mylène Dinh-Robic), who runs poaching and prostitution rings and who became a victim of Pagan's cruelty herself after he kidnapped her family; and Yuma Lau (Gwendoline Yeo), Min's adopted sister and trusted general who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of the mystical realm of Shangri-La.

                            However the Golden Path's newfound momentum is threatened by deep divisions between its commanders, Sabal, who favors traditional values, and Amita (Janina Gavankar), who argues for progress, which includes relying heavily on drug trade. Ajay is forced to intervene on several occasions, with his decisions influencing the direction the Golden Path takes. The first governor to fall is De Pleur after Noore helps Ajay find a way to infiltrate De Pleur's stronghold, allowing the rebellion to capture him. Amita and Sabal later task Ajay with confronting and killing Noore. She dies in her fighting arena, either with Ajay killing her, or with Noore committing suicide upon learning Pagan had her family executed years beforehand.

                            As the Golden Path secures Kyrat's southern provinces, Ajay is contacted by Willis Huntley (Alain Goulem), a CIA agent who offers intelligence for the rebels and pages from his father's diary in exchange for killing Yuma's lieutenants. After Ajay kills several of them, Huntley admits they were in fact CIA assets, and that he was sent to clean up after the CIA as the agency did not see Pagan as a threat anymore. Huntley betrays Ajay to Pagan just as the Golden Path prepare to push into Northern Kyrat.

                            Ajay ends up in Yuma's mountain prison, from which he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother.[b] The Golden Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the Golden Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the Golden Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other to prevent them from starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the Golden Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the Golden Path holds off the military.
